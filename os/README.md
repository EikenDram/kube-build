# OS for running a kubernetes cluster

Ended up with:
- `coreos` - [Fedora CoreOS](https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/)

Haven't tried, but was choosing between:
- `fedora` - [Fedora Server](https://fedoraproject.org/en/server/)
- `flatcar` - [Flatcar Container Linux](https://www.flatcar.org/)
- `ubuntu` - [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)
- `talos` - [Talos](https://www.talos.dev/)
